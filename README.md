# PCVOptimization
 A python algorithm to optimize the traveling salesman problem

It consists in use two heuristic construction algorithms, and use two local seach algorithm to improve the solution.
Developed in python because the language is better when talking about processing speed for big graphs.
The final result is the local best distance to achieve the path from origem, passing every node, until the end of the graph, and return to origin.
